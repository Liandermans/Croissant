      <p>
        Croissants are a popular pastry, known for their crescent shape and
        flaky, buttery texture. While the exact origin of the croissant is
        debated, it is commonly associated with France. Some accounts trace its
        roots back to the 17th century in Austria, but it gained popularity and
        became synonymous with French cuisine over time.

        Traditional croissants are made from a laminated dough, which is a dough
        layered with butter. The main ingredients include flour, water, yeast,
        salt, sugar, and butter. The dough is rolled and folded multiple times
        to create layers, resulting in the pastry's flaky texture.
